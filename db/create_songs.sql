    ('House Finch','Male House Finches sing a long, jumbled warbling composed of short notes. The song often ends with an upward or downward slur, and lasts about 3 seconds. Males may sing throughout the year. Females sometimes give a shorter, simpler version of the song. Compared with Cassins and Purple finches, House Finch songs sound slower, rougher, and somewhat less fluid. The final slurred note is more often heard in House Finches than in the other two species.', '28', 'https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/House_Finch/sounds', 5);
